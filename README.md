# Matrix-multiplication-Theaded
Matrix Multiplication with Threading (C)  This project implements matrix multiplication in C, demonstrating two threading approaches for parallel computation:     1) Element-wise Threading: Each element of the result matrix is computed in its own thread.     2) Row-wise Threading: Each row of the result matrix is computed in a separate thread.
